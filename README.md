# Checking for overlaps between time intervals
#### This is a sample code wherein the beneficiaries claim dates dataset is merged with the IP claims dataset to extract the cost of only those months for which there is a PB claim found. This code ensures that no double counting happens and the cost during overlapping is not double-counted. This part only contains the dates for which the cost will be extracted. Once the final dataset is obtained the cost corresponding to these dates can be used to calculate the cost of IP for the beneficiaries
